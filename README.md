# Kharebga
A simplified version of a traditional Tunisian board game with 2 players. Made with Node JS & Socket.io.

Based on https://github.com/ayushgp/tic-tac-toe-socket-io 

Set up:
in the project folder type "npm install" in the terminal.

Game rules:
This game has two phases with different rules.
In phase one each player places two pawns per turn. Each has 12 pawns and you can’t place any in the middle spot. The placement must be strategic because winning or losing depends a lot on it.
In phase two you can destroy an opponent’s paws by cornering it between two of your own pawns.
The first to destroy all of his opponent’s pawns wins.
